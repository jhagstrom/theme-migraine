## Migraine, theme for Visual Studio Code
This is my first go at creating a Visual Studio Code theme. The color scheme is probably not for everyone, but I have been using the same basic colors in Visual Studio for a long time now and it works well for me.

Below are a few screenshots visualizing the theme in use editing C#, PowerShell and JSON.
